# Praesidio Hardware

This repository contains the hardware modules necessary to show that the Praesidio enclave system is feasible. For more information on the overall system look at the [initial paper on Praesidio](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3411505.3418437).

These sources have been tested to work in [CHERI Toooba](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/Toooba.git), but they are transferable to other processors as well.
